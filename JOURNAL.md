uhh I didn't make much progress today, however i picked my song(劇上 by YOASOBI), prepared my audio and started making the map!
## Song
Somehow, it was surprisingly hard to find a song to map as I wanted one that hasn't been mapped yet and that I actually like. After doomscrolling (listening?) to spotify, I realised that one of my favourite artists had released a new song, and I just decided to do that.

## Preparing
The majority of what I did today was setting up my audio using the guide from the BSMG wiki. I did the basic steps which were converting .flac to .ogg (in audacity), doing the bpm blackmagic in arrowvortex, adding silence in audactiy and setting up a chromapper project
